INSTALLATION
0. The easiest way to install an AVD is through Android Studio by creating a virtual device. The manual installation process is described below.

1. Install the latest versions of Java (OpenJDK) and cmdline-tools, then set the environment variable path (JAVA_HOME).

1.1 Execute commands in the following path:
	C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\bin

1.2 During the first setup, you may need to run:
	sdkmanager --licenses

2.1 Install essential tools:
	sdkmanager "platform-tools" "emulator"

2.2 Install packages (for example, Android 33 with Play Store image):
	sdkmanager "platforms;android-33" "system-images;android-33;google_apis_playstore;x86_64"

3.1 To list available system images (image_name):
	sdkmanager --list

3.2 To list available device types (device_type):
	avdmanager list devices

4. Create a virtual device:
	avdmanager create avd -n <name> -d <device_type> -k <image_name>

Done. The emulator is ready to be launched.

0. The tools are located in the following paths (you can add them to the PATH variable for convenience):
	C:\Users<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator
	C:\Users<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools

1. After adding the paths or navigating to the folder, view the available devices:

2. Select a device to emulate:
	emulator -avd <name>

The device is now running.
