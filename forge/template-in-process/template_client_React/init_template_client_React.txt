PROJECT CREATION AND LAUNCH
0. AVD (for Android) must be installed and set up

WARNING!!! A shorter project path helps avoid Windows’ 260-character limit, which can break tools like CMake and Ninja during builds. Keeping your project closer to the drive root dramatically reduces these risks.

1. Go to the folder where you want to store the project (do not create the project folder yourself) and run the command below. npx will suggest installing any missing libraries and will create the project folder for you:
	npx @react-native-community/cli init <name> --version 0.82.1

2. To check requirements, use:
	npx react-native doctor

3. To run the project (on Android):
	npx react-native run-android
	
4. When the clean project runs without issues, copy the files from the template into the root of the project with replacement, and install the packages
	npm install
	
5. Rename metro.config.js -> metro.config.сjs

N. Done. The project is ready to use
////////////

Launching tools separately
In the container, start only the Metro server:
	npx react-native start [ --reset-cache]
		where:  --reset-cache is an optional parameter to clear the metro cache before launch

On the host machine, start only the build (default Metro port is 8081):
		npx react-native run-android --port 8081
