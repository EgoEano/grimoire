# 🪶 Developer's Grimoire  
### _Personal knowledge base and technical notes_

> “Every engineer needs a grimoire — a place to preserve their hard-earned knowledge, insights, and experiments.”

## 📘 About
This repository is my **developer knowledge base** — a living collection of:
- Fundamental algorithms and data structures.  
- System setup guides and rare-use instructions.  
- Configuration notes, experiments, and troubleshooting patterns.  

It’s designed as a **reference library** — a grimoire to return to when memory fades or when setting up something from scratch.
